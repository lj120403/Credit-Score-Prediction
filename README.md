# Credit-Score-Prediction

Credit risk prediction is essential for financial institutions such as banks because it helps them to make informed decisions regarding lending money. Since lending money is a risky business, financial institutions need to ensure that they lend money to individuals or firms with a high probability of paying back the money. Banks and financial institutions who can’t assess credit risk accurately lead towards financial uncertainty and eventually, bankruptcy. Credit risk prediction is vital because it helps the financial institutions mitigate the risk of default by analyzing different factors that influence a borrower’s ability to pay back the amount. The traditional credit scoring model only rely on a few variables such as age, income, financial history, credit history; however, these methods aren’t enough to provide the complete information regarding the borrower’s creditworthiness. To get an improved accuracy than traditional credit scoring models, machine learning (ML) techniques are used to analyze large amount of data to make better credit decisions. The ML models help to identify patterns and relationships in big data that humans may miss doing it manually. This allows the lenders to make informed decisions with respect to credit decisions and it reduces the probability of default.
